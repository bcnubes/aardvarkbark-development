review_text = "I just had 20 yards of bark delivered and blown into parts of my yard. It looks AMAZING!! I have a huge back yard and knew there was no way I could haul all that bark. Dan and Jack were great. They had the job done quick and clean. It looks so good, if it weren't so hot out I would be just sitting outside staring at it. I cannot recommend them enough!"
