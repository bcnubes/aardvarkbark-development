review_text = "Loved our experience with Aardvark Bark! Our whole experience from calling and scheduling to the install of the bark was fantastic! Dan and Pedro were so easy to work with and did an amazing job. We run a doggie daycare and we ordered playground bark chips for our backyard yard to fix our mud problem and we couldn’t be happier. The dogs love it and we love not having mud tracked into our home. I highly recommend using them."
